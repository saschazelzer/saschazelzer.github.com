Together with Alexander Broekhuis, I will be talking at the [OSGi Community Event 2012][osgi-event]
in Ludwigsburg (Germany) about Native OSGi. The talk will be a 55 minutes extended talk, organized as two
25 minutes talks (plus discussion). Here is the [talk abstract](http://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2012/sessions/native-osgi-modular-software-development-native-world)
and the [second part](http://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2012/sessions/native-osgi-modular-software-development-native-world-part-2). There will also be another talk related to Native OSGi, called [Universal Declarative Services](http://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2012/sessions/universal-declarative-services),
at which you should definitely have a look at.

This year, the OSGi Community Event is co-located with [EclipseCon Europe 2012](http://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2012/) and
there is a nice [Session Schedule](http://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2012/program/session-schedule) overview available.
I am looking forward to many interesting discussions about Native OSGi and to meet some of the community members in
real life (again). If you are interested in Native OSGi, you should definitely consider to register for the OSGi Community Event!
