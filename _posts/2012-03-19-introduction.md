The C++ micro Services Blog will contain posts about my current technological interests and research.

This includes, but is not limited to, programming languages, software design, and component and service oriented architectures.

Stay tuned for the next post, which will try to give an overview about the state of current efforts of implementing the OSGi specifications (which were written specifically for Java) in C++.
