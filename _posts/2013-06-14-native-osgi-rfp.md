[RFP 156][rfp156-bug] entitled *Native OSGi* has been
published on the OSGi bug tracker a month ago. It aims at reviving parts of RFP 89 (Universal OSGi)
with a focus on providing an OSGi Core specification for the C and C++ programming languages.

The joined efforts of different people interested in creating a native OSGi specification and
implementation started back in May last year during a
[Native OSGi Developers Meeting](http://blog.cppmicroservices.org/2012/05/26/native-osgi-meeting-hengelo)
in Hengelo.
Since then there have been presentations about the idea of Native OSGi at the OSGi Community
Event 2012 ([link](http://blog.cppmicroservices.org/2012/09/09/native-osgi-at-osgi-con))
and at ApacheCon Europe 2012 ([link](http://www.apachecon.eu/schedule/presentation/102/)).

With the help and feedback from people involved in the OSGi specifications, RFP 156 finally was published.
I encourage interested parties to contribute to it by adding comments, use cases, requirements, etc. to
the [Bugzilla ticket][rfp156-bug].
