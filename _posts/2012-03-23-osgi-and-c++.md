Last week I attended the [OSGi Community Event 2011](http://www.osgi.org/CommunityEvent2011) in Darmstadt and had the opportunity to shortly discuss the state of native C++ implementations of the [OSGi](http://www.osgi.org) specifications with other attendees. This also motivated me to finish this post about the current state of projects trying to implement a OSGi - like framework in C/C++.<!--more-->

Introduction
------------

In the past, I used to write Eclipse plug-ins for fun. The OSGi component model leveraged by Eclipse was fascinating and full of insights.

Nowadays, I program mostly in C++ but I am still trying to follow the developments and trends in OSGi and Java in general. Although there are many high-quality C++ libraries which help to create complex systems, the options for a C++ library/framework enabling component (and/or service) oriented designs are limited. Depending on your requirements, this set of options might be reduced substantially. I will try to give a review of active projects which try to model the OSGi API in C or C++. Complex [middleware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware) frameworks (like [CORBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corba)) or [SCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_component_architecture) implementations which allow a service oriented design but which either are not available for C++ or lack development activity (the last [Apache Tuscany C++](http://tuscany.apache.org/sca-native.html) release is from 2007) will not be discussed.

As you will see below, there has been growing interest for a C++ OSGi framework in the last couple of years. Several independent projects picked up the OSGi design principles and try to translate them to C or C++. The biggest drawback of these efforts - in my opinion - is the lack of a C++ OSGi community (if you know of one, please let me know). Although a couple of projects exist, they live isolated from each other and yet lack a large user base.

Native and Universal OSGi
-------------------------

In 2007, RFP-89 (Request for Proposal) was filed for specifying a system dubbed *Universal OSGi*. A short discussion on the
[Universal OSGi mailinglist](http://www.osgi.org/MailLists/Universal) followed and Peter Kriens blogged about the idea
[here](http://www.osgi.org/blog/2007/10/universal-osgi.html "Universal OSGi"). In short, the idea was to be able to access service objects
written in other languages (not Java) via the OSGi service registry (possibly using some kind if IPC mechansims under the hood).
The central orchestration unit would still be a Java OSGi implementation with additional capabilities for managing *native bundles*.

The term *Native OSGi* seems to appear more often in the context of translating OSGi principles to a native OSGi framework implementation
(for example implemented in C or C++). Such native frameworks which can be used on their own are the focus of this post. Of course a
native OSGi framework will have a much bigger impact if it provides Java interoperability in the sense of Universal OSGi (hence being
a super set in terms of provided functionality). You can find a short discussion about
the [state of Universal OSGi dating from September 2008 here](https://mail.osgi.org/pipermail/osgi-dev/2008-September/001450.html).
The mentioned paper [*The Software Fabric for the Internet of Things*](http://systems.ethz.pubzone.org/servlet/Attachment?attachmentId=43&versionId=716259)
([doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-78731-0_6)) written by Jan Rellermeyer et.al. describes a light-weight JNI based approach
for handling interoperability between native (C++) and Java services. Unfortunately, I could not find the native code anywhere (the
Java implementation for remote OSGi services can be found [here](http://r-osgi.sourceforge.net/ "R-OSGi")).

The interest in a Native OSGi solution does not seem to vanish (see 
[1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2627114/c-modularization-framework-like-osgi "C++ modularization framework (like OSGI)?"),
[2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7069144/how-to-compose-osgi-based-project-with-c-based-project "How to Compose OSGi Based project with C++ based project?"),
[3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9249708/is-there-a-non-java-alternative-to-osgi "Is there a non Java alternative to OSGi?"), and
[4](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5127981/portable-c-component-design "Portable C++ Component Design")) but it surely is not (yet?) mainstream.
Another [blog post by Peter Kriens from October 2010](http://www.osgi.org/blog/2010/10/minimal-osgi-systems.html "Minimal OSGi systems")
picks up the Universal OSGi idea again and points to a [proposal for an Apache Incubator project](http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/CelixProposal "Celix Proposal")
providing a C implementation of OSGi. I will provide some details about the current state of art concerning Native OSGi implementations
in the next sections.
